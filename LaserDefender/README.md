# *Laser Defender*

Laser Defender is a top down space shooter in a similar vain as Space Invaders. I was looking for something that would be easy to create and rather well known to put my spin on.

Really though, this is just an exercise in playing with Unity.

### **Features Implemented**
At the current time I have the following features implemented
* The player moves with WASD and shoots with the left mouse button.
* The enemies randomly choose one of two formations to descend on the player with.
  * The enemies will also shoot at the player with a random time delay.

### Features to come
* **A Health System for the player** - I have my sights on adding a health system to the player. That way when the player gets hit by the enemies laser, it actually does something.
* **More Formations** - Right now there is two, and they consistently attack from the top coming down. I want to add more and also add variety in the way they move. (The first thought was have a circle that rotates around the origin point, the second was just attacking from the left to the right).
* **A scoring system** - It doesn't have to be that elaborate. Just similar to something that was done in my Unity Course's 3D Pong Game (Hyperpaddle)
* **Bosses.** - These could spawn in at a certain ellapsed time or point value. They would come with their own hitpoints and perhaps more deadly projectiles.

* Graphics and sound effects - Currently, the graphics for the ships and the lasers as well as the sounds for the lasers are provided by [Kenney.nl](http://www.kenney.nl). They were part of the "Space Shooter Redux" package on OpenGameArt.org.
