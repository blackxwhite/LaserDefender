Things that should be implemented into Laser Defender before I can consider it feature complete
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Explosions															 														:: Completed on June 5th
	- Animations for the explosions
	- Sounds for the explosions

- More Formations
	- Currently: 3 Implemented
	- Goal: 7

- A variety of enemies
	- Currently: 2
	- Goal: 5
		-Each one does a different amount of damage
		-Perhaps attacks differently? (ie the formation spins rather than stays stagnate)

- Bosses
	- Minimum: One?
	- It kind of depends on how many levels I get.
	
- Levels																															:: It was decided that an infinite playing style works better.
	- Minimum: 3
	- What differentiates a level?
		- This is something that I am going to have to consider. The first two thoughts are time or score.
		- Tougher enemies

- Scoring System																												:: Implemented on Jun 19, 2015

- Repeated Spawning of various formations 																			:: Completed on June 5th

- The Garbage Collector for ships that go off the screen  														:: Completed on June 5th

- A way to display the health of the player.																			
	- Not sure if I want to go with a quick and easy text display or a health bar.
	- Health bar sounds interesting but takes up a lot of real estate
	
- Global High Scores

- Power Ups
	- In the very least a health pack
	- Double Laser
